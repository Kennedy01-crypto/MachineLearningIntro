# Machine Learning Intro

Welcome to the Machine Learning Intro repository! This repository is designed for beginners who are interested in exploring various machine learning algorithms and models.

## Current Models

As of now, the repository includes the following machine learning models:

- **Decision Trees**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences. It is a popular method for classification and regression tasks.
- **Linear Regression**: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for predictive analysis.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand this repository by adding more machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes. It is used extensively in various fields, including finance and healthcare.

## Getting Started

To get started with the models, you can clone the repository and explore the provided Jupyter notebooks and datasets.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for additional models or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
