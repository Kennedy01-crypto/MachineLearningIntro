# Music Recommendation System

## Description

This is a simple machine learning project that aims to recommend music genres based on user preferences. The project utilizes a dataset that contains information about different music genres liked by various age groups among males and females.

## Dataset

The dataset is divided into two sets:

- **Training Dataset**: 80% of the data used to train the model.
- **Testing Dataset**: 20% of the data used to evaluate the model's performance.

## How It Works

1. The program trains a machine learning model using the training dataset.
2. It makes predictions based on the trained model.
3. The predictions are compared to the actual test data to gauge the model's accuracy.

## Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and execute the main script.
